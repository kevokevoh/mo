# Spec
The cycle of payment, crediting, locking and unlocking is basic, but automated. However, a segment of our users is indicating that they are not happy with the very limited access to information. We currently have no app or web portal to service our users for information (for example, to find out their outstanding balance) they depend on SMS or a basic WhatsApp bot.
# Bottleneck
The rudimentary nature of the service available to users has three impacts:
● The lack of clarity and communication might have a negative impact on our credit quality; i.e. well-intended users are not paying on time because they struggle to
● A lot of valuable resources are spent on basic customer queries - users might chat over SMS to customer support agent just to find out their balance
● Users that are getting caught up in this process are not having great experience and will not recommend us. resulting in reduced word-of-mouth

# Questions
## What type of data analysis would you like to do to inform yourself on the problem? What insights would you be looking for?
### Customer Support Query Analysis:
Looking for: Types of querries made by user, average response times, frequency and channel used by the users(SMS, Whatsapp etc)

Insights:
- Identify what information is the most pressing for users(in this case we assume it is balance enquiry) so the team can work on improving balance querry.
- Identify what the most frequent basic querries and identify the time and resources spent on resolving them and whether the users can be empowered to self service and reduce interaction volumes.

### User Engagement and Payment Behavior Analysis
Looking for: Payment patterns specifically late payments and defaults and how that correlates with the volume of balance querries(in this case over whatsapp bot and SMS) or there are other user querries.

Insights:
- Identify if there is a pattern of lack of quick information access and late or default payments
- Identify user behavior and pain points in the systems

### Customer Satisfaction Analysis
Looking for: Overall satisfaction scores, feedback on customer support interactions, user features and pain points

Insights:
- Identify if user satisfaction has an impact on user retention and referrals.
- Identify user suggested features and improvements.
- Identify the key drivers of satisfaction and how lack of information ranks in this case.

### User Journey Mapping
Looking for: Typical user journey for payments, identify friction points, based on hypothesis ie lack of information

Insights
- Identify critical points of improvement, unnecesary steps
- Identify a clear user path to guide new features and simplification

### Word of Mouth and Referal Analysis
Looking for: Refferal data, sources of new customers, correlate with user satisfaction

Insights:
- Identify percentage of new users based on referals and trends
-  Identify impact that user disatisfaction has on referral rates

### Competitor Analysis
Looking for: innovative approaches to information dissemination

Insights:
- Identify industry standards and see if they apply to the current problem being experienced

### A/B Testing
Looking for: User engagement and satisfaction based on feedback loops

Insights:
- Identify the most effective solutions before going into a full blow feature development

## In the context of the MoPhones reality, what would you suggest are the three main online existing user digital product priorities and what framework would you use to prioritize these?

- Mobile/ Web App - Access to information ie previous payments, loan balances and due dates for payments
- Self-Service Information Portal - Expand and upgrade the two-way SMS and whatsapp bot for added functionality to serve users.
- Coomunication and Notification Systems - ie Push notifications and reminders for payments, due dates through multiple channels ie email, SMS, Whatsapp etc

- I'd probably use a hybrid of  RICE(Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort) Approach as well as the company OKRs(Objective and Key Results) to align efforts efficiently with needs of users and the company.

## How would you go about executing on one of these priorities? Outline your approach from initial research to launch.

- Research and Discovery ie Go over the existing surveys and csats and identify the immediate needs for the self- service information portal, define hypothesis for developemnt
- Scoping and Alignment ie define scope of work and align with stakeholders
- Design and Development Planning ie Mockups and architecture diagrams
- Development and Testing - Develop the features and ensure comprehensive testing of feature sets
- Internal and Beta Testing - Release feature to internal users and beta users to see if they meet the desired needs of users
- Documentation, Soft and full launch - Depending on the team WoWs we can document the features, do a soft launch and full launch of the new features
- Post Launch Evaluation - Did the features meet the hypothesis needs or is there need for more development on the same.

## What would be individual contributions you could make on each phase of the product development process?
### Research and Discovery
- Analyse user feedback and convert the findings into actionable insights
- Create initial requirements
### Scoping and Alignment
- Facilitate discussions on priorities based on findings
- Convert decisions into action items and feature-sets
### Design and Development Planning
- Collaborate with designers on wireframes and prototypes as well as user testing if its in the team WoWs
- Analyze feedback and suggestions and present to the team for improvements
- Ensure alignment between design and development teams
### Development and Testing
- Convert prototypes into working designs
- Lead in feature development
- Communicate progress efficiently to stakeholders
- Actively participate in Code Reviews
- Ensure 100% test coverege for E2E, Contract and Unit tests
### Internal and Beta Testing
- Involvement in testing sessions
- Prioritise bug fixes and improvements
- Ensure critical issues are addressed
- Analyse results and feedback and decide on final adjustments
### Documentation, Soft and Full Launch
- Ensure documentation is up-to-date
- Build CI/CD tools incase of rollbacks or issues during launch
- Address arising issues quickly
- Monitor to ensure everything is working as expected
### Post Launch Evaluation
- Analyse user behavior and feedback and communicate to team and stakeholders
- identify arears for improvement
- Identify arears for next iteration and development
